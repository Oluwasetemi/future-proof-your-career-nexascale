# Learning How To Learn

It is a first principle thing to grasp the concept of learning, not only will it be useful in your career but it will help you in every phase of life.

Learning how to learn is a life long learning journey, it involves you grasping the <span v-mark.underline.red>concepts of deconstruction</span> and <span v-mark.underline.pink>recombination of Knowledge</span>. It requires having the super power of figuring things out, maybe a childlike wonder. A child will always wonder at everything and in curiosity want to know the mystery behind the operations of anything they come in contact with.

It is the courage to take on a piece of information and distill it till you are able to reproduce it in several format.

<!-- Use code snippets and get the highlighting directly, and even types hover![^1]

import { computed, ref } from 'vue'

const count = ref(0)
const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2)

doubled.value = 2

# Searching For The Best Resources

<br />

<p v-click>A very successful famous Silicon valley investor, Naval shares his opinions that - if you are the best mathematics teacher in the world then you should be teaching the world mathematics. It means that if you want to get so good at this coding career you must look for the best resources out there with good explanation and high bar for excellence.</p>

<br />
<br />

<p v-click="2">A final destination for high quality content is Open Source, contibution and looking through codebase on GitHub will expose you to how mad some people can write amazing software. The world is more open than ever.</p>

# Motivation and Discipline

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

Motivation

> People can help you in many ways throughout life, but there are two things nobody can give you: curiosity and drive. They must be self-supplied.
>

- You are the pilot of your destiny
- Sapa
- Situation
- Whatever your reason, stay motivated

</div>
<div>

Discipline

> If you said you will do something, then show up and do it.
>

<br />

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Vu2ew98mO1kZi" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/disney-mulan-walt-disney-animation-studios-shang-Vu2ew98mO1kZi"></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Living a purpose driven life will always be a source of drive and a deep reason for your WHY. It reminds me of books like START WITH WHY by Simon Sinek, Drive by David Pink and the famous Atomic Habits by James Clear.</p>

# Understand the Trends

Understand the times and season in your life, career and tech space.

- the wind rush of AI is real, find a way to fit in.
- Standard is high
- Stop wanting to be the friend of the Unicodeveloper, Adora, Hacksultan and co build up your circle
- Rise of fall of programming language and technologies e.g React and JavaScript
- Know your tools and the every new features

# Some soft skills and Technical skills

---
> "The producer of old age is habit: the deathly process of doing the same thing in the same way at the same hour day after day, first from carelessness, then from inclination, at last from cowardice or inertia.

> Habit is necessary; but it is the habit of having careless habits, of turning a trail into a rut, that must be incessantly fought against if one is to remain alive... one can remain alive long past the usual date of disintegration if one is unafraid of change, insatiable in intellectual curiosity, interested in big things, and happy in small ways."
>
> -- Edith Wharton
